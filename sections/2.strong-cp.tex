\chapter{The Strong CP Problem}

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force as experienced by quarks and mediated by gluons.
QCD is a very successful theory, in terms of its predictive success and from a theoretical viewpoint. \note{Why?}
QCD suffers from a fine-tuning problem known as the \emph{strong $CP$ problem}.


The dynamics of the gauge bosons of QCD, like any other gauge theory, may be considered independently of any matter fields.

The Lagrangian of gluon self-interaction is
\begin{align}
	\cal L = a\ang{F,F}
\end{align}
where $a$ is a constant and 


In finding possible kinetic terms of a gauge field $\tsbm A$, we demand that the it be Lorentz invariant and gauge invariant.
In addition, we demand that the kinetic term be at most quadratic in $\tsbm A$, and depend on derivatives no higher than first.
These requirements restrict the form of the kinetic term to a linear combination of
\begin{align}
	\ang{\tsbm F, \tsbm F}
	&\qqtext{and}
	\ang{\tsbm F, \star\tsbm F}
\\	\text{i.e.,}\qquad
	% g^{\mu\rho}g^{\rho\sigma}\bm F_{\mu\nu}\bm F_{\rho\sigma}
	\bm F_{\mu\nu}\bm F^{\mu\nu}
	&\qqtext{and}
	\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\bm F_{\mu\nu}\bm F_{\rho\sigma}
,\end{align}
where $\tsbm F \in \Omega^2(\cal M, \mathfrak g)$ is the field strength 2-form associated to the gauge field $\tsbm A$;
the inner product $\ang{\ ,\ }$ is a particular choice of inner product on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ extended to $\mathfrak g$-valued forms on $\cal M$;
and $\star\tsbm F$ is its Hodge dual with respect to the metric $\ts g$ on $\cal M$.
\begin{align}
	\ts{\bm F} &= \ts{\dd\bm A} + \ts{\bm A} \wedge \ts{\bm A}
% \\	&= \qty(\ts{\dd A}^a{}_b + \ts A^a{}_c \wedge \ts A^c{}_b) \bm e_a \otimes \bm e_b
% \\	&= \qty(\partial_\mu\bm A_\nu + \bm A_\mu \bm A_\nu) \ts{\dd x}^\mu \wedge \ts{\dd x}^\nu
% \\	&= \qty(\partial_\mu A_\nu{}^a{}_b +  A_\mu{}^a{}_c A_\nu{}^c{}_b) \ts{\dd x}^\mu \wedge \ts{\dd x}^\nu \otimes \bm e_a \otimes \bm e^b
\\ F_{\mu\nu}{}^a{}_b &= \partial_\mu A_\nu{}^a{}_b +  A_\mu{}^a{}_c A_\nu{}^c{}_b
,\end{align}
and $\star\tsbm F$ is its Hodge dual with respect to the metric on $\cal M$,
\begin{align}
	(\star\bm F)_{\mu\nu} = \frac12 \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\bm F^{\rho\sigma}
	% (\star\bm F)_{\mu\nu} = \frac12 \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}g^{\rho\alpha}g^{\sigma\beta}\bm F_{\alpha\beta}
.\end{align}
