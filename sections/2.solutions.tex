\chapter{Solutions to the Strong CP Problem}

At first sight, the strong \CP\ problem may not appear to be a problem at all.
There is a theory, which possibly---but not necessarily---admits a term which gives rise to \CP-violating interactions in the strong force and consequently to an electric dipole moment of the neutron.
Upon measurement, the neutron's electric dipole moment, and the \CP-violating term is ruled out by experiment.
From a phenomenological perspective, it is satisfactory to simply end the story here.

The strong \CP\ problem differers from other fine-tuning problems in the standard model \note{such as} in that it is of almost no consequence to everyday physics, and thus has no anthropic solution.
Whereas variations of the cosmological constant, the weak scale or the quark and lepton masses lead to universe very different to our own, variation of the $\theta$-parameter hardly affects nuclear physics because it is suppressed by quark masses.

A trivial way to `resolve' the strong \CP\ problem is to simply require that \CP\ be a symmetry of the strong force.
However, this is tautological and only reinforces the problem of why \CP\ symmetry appears to be preserved in some sectors of the standard model while it is broken in others.

\section{Peccei--Quinn Theory}

Perhaps the most well-known proposed resolution to the strong \CP\ problem is the Peccei--Quinn theory of the \emph{axion}, first proposed in 1977 \cite{PecceiQuinn_1977}.
The axion is well-known in cosmology because of the its allure as a dark matter candidate.

Peccei--Quinn theory explains the small value of $\theta$ by its promotion to a dynamical field whose potential is minimised when $\theta = 0$.
In other words, a new $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry is introduced (whose action is to rotate $\theta$) and adjoined to the gauge group of QCD.
The QCD Lagrangian is modified by the addition of a potential with minimum at $\theta = 0$, which is said to \emph{spontaneously break} the Peccei--Quinn $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry.
The gauge field associated to this $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry is named the \emph{axion field}, and the gauge bosons obtained upon quantisation are named \emph{axions}.
