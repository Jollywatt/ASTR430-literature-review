\chapter{Axions in Cosmology}


With the advent of precision cosmology in the 21st century, particle physicists can use the entire universe as a laboratory for ever more sensitive experiments.
Depending on the strength and variety of their interactions with other matter, axions may have significant implications for the evolution of the universe and of astrophysical structures, leaving behind detectable signatures.
Of special interest is the axion's promise as a dark matter candidate.
This section is a review of the current status of the axion in cosmology; its astrophysical predictions and observational constraints.
Primary sources are Cadamuro, Hannestad \etal., \cite[{}2011]{Cadamuro_2011} and Irastorza and Redondo \cite[{}2018]{Irastorza_2018}, along with sections of the Particle Data Group's \emph{Review of Particle Physics} \cite[{}2020]{ParticleDataGroup-review-2020}.






\section{The Standard Cosmological Picture}

Many cosmological tests of axion-like particles involve predicting relative particle abundances in the universe at various epochs, such as the baryon-to-photon or neutrino-to-photon ratios.
Such arguments begin with a minimal `thermodynamical' model of the universe as a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding background upon which different particle species exist in uniform thermal equilibrium.
The universe's macrostate is characterised by each species' abundance and energy distribution, and is characterised by a cosmological temperature, $T$, quantifying average energy density.
Interactions and processes between species, which at any time may depend on present particle abundances and energies, define differential relations which can be solved to determine the abundance of each species at any point in the universe's evolution.
In general, this is expressed by the \emph{Boltzmann transport equation}, describing the statistical behaviour of a thermodynamic system out of equilibrium \cite[§\,3]{Irastorza_2018}


The harsh assumptions of isotropy and homogeneity specify a spacetime with a Friedmann--Lemaître--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) metric,
\begin{align}
	% \ts g = -c^2 \ts\dd t\otimes\ts\dd t + a(t)^2\qty(η_{ij}\,\ts\dd x^i\otimes\ts\dd x^j)
	\ts g = -c^2 \ts\dd t^2 + a(t)^2\qty(\frac{\ts\dd r^2}{1 - kr^2} + r^2 \ts Θ)
\end{align}
where $k \in \qty{+1, 0, -1}$ reflects the type of spatial curvature, $\ts Θ = \ts\dd θ^2 + \sinθ\,\ts\dd φ^2$ is the metric of the unit sphere, and $\ts\dd x^2 \equiv \ts\dd x\otimes\ts\dd x$.
Standard cosmological models are spatially flat with $k = 0$.
The scale factor $a(t)$ describes the cosmological evolution of the universe and defines the \emph{Hubble parameter,} $H \coloneqq \dot{a}/a$, or cosmic expansion rate.
The equations of general relativity determine $a(t)$ uniquely in terms of the mass--energy content of the universe.

	\item \emph{thermalisation}
---	the process of a particle species reaching thermal equilibrium (i.e., uniform energy and abundance) over cosmological scales, mitigated by energy-diffusing self-interactions or processes with other species.
	\item \emph{freeze-out}
---	the point beyond which the rates of thermalising processes become negligible due to cooling cosmological temperature or accelerating cosmic expansion. Freeze-out results in persistent non-equilibrium distributions of a particle species, analogous to a change of phase from a gas to a cooler condensate.
% Since the universe cools as it expands, freeze-out may be viewed as a species' change of phase from a gas to a cooler condensate.

If the rate $Γ$ of a particle interaction is large (corresponding to large probability per unit spacetime volume for the interaction to occur), then it will provide a mechanism for thermalisation of the species involved---or in the case of production and decay processes, will drive the species to abundance or extinction. 
If the rate is smaller than the rate of cosmic expansion, $Γ \ll H$, then the interaction or process will freeze-out and become negligible.
Freeze-out may also result from the cosmological temperature $T$ being lower than a processes' threshold energy.
If a species' most dominant interactions freeze-out, then it becomes thermally isolated from other matter and its abundance remains fixed.








\section{Axion Interactions and Processes}

Axions spontaneously decay into photons via the axion-photon vertex at a well-known rate
\begin{align}
	Γ_{a\to 2γ} = \frac{g_{aγγ}^2m_a^3}{64π} \approx 10^{-24}\,\si{\per\second}\qty(\frac{m_a}{\si{\eV}})^5
,\end{align}
where the coupling strength $g_{aγγ}$ can be approximately written in terms of the mass $m_a$ (which introduces an overall $\cal O(1)$ dependence on the particular axion model) \cite{Cadamuro_2011}.
Thus, for axions to exist in significant abundance in the present epoch, they must be sufficiently light, or else the decay process dominates.
If they are too light, $m_a < \SI{18}{\eV}$, than the axion half-life exceeds the age of the universe.
An inverse decay process $2γ \to a$ is also possible, with a rate $Γ_{2γ \to a} \propto 1/T$ increasing as the universe cools.
This implies that axions may recouple to photons at late stages of the universe's evolution \cite{Marsh_2016}.

Axions also interact by the strong force with hadronic matter via the gluon-axion vertex, giving rise to the Primakoff (and, for leptonic axions, Compton) electron scattering processes shown in figure~\ref{fig:scattering-processes}.
When the universe is sufficiently hot, $T \gg m_a$, the rate of Primakoff scattering $Γ_\text{P} \propto g_{aγγ}^2n_e$ is proportional to the number density of electrons-plus-positions, $n_e$ \cite{Cadamuro_2011}.
For leptonic (e.g., DFSZ) axions, Cadamuro \etal.~\cite{Cadamuro_2011} approximate the rate of Compton scattering as
\begin{align}
	Γ_\text{C} \propto \frac{g_{aee}^2n_e}{\max\qty{T^2, m_a^2}}
.\end{align}
These scattering processes, along with photon decay and inverse decay, are the dominant interactions relevant to the cosmological arguments employed by Cadamuro \etal.
The freeze-out temperatures of these processes vary non-linearly with axion mass, summarised in figure~\ref{fig:axion-freeze-out}.

By the analysis of Cadamuro \etal., axions remain in thermal equilibrium at all temperatures for $m_a \gtrsim \SI{20}{\kilo\eV}$ ($m_a \gtrsim \SI{10}{\kilo\eV}$ for leptonic axions), while lighter axions freeze-out around $T \sim 10^2\,\si{\kilo\eV}$ before eventually recoupling by inverse decay when the universe cools enough.
Extremely light axions, $m_a \lesssim \SI{200}{\eV}$, remain thermally isolated from all matter forever after recombination where $T \lesssim 10^5\,\si{\K}$.






\subsection{Constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis}

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Temperature $T$ of the universe from the Big Bang to the present, with major epochs indicated.}
\end{figure}

A few minutes after the beginning of time, when the universe cooled to $\sim 10^{10}\,\si{\K}$ during \emph{Big Bang nucleosynthesis} (BBN), protons and neutrons began to bind together to form light atomic nuclei.
The primary fusion reactions that occurred are:
\begin{align}
	\el{p + n} &\to \el{^2H} + γ
\\	\el{p + {}^2H} &\to \el{^3He} + γ
\\	\el{^2H + {}^2H} &\to \el{^3He + n, {}^3H + p}
\\	\el{^3He + {}^2H} &\to \el{^4He + p}
\\	&\ \vdots
\end{align}
Photons are involved in the production of deuterium $^2\el H$ and the lightest isotopes of helium, but not in the fusion of heavier nuclei.
An analysis of the reaction rates provides a relationship between the photon abundance $n_γ$ and the abundance of light nuclei (i.e., baryons, $n_B$).
A larger initial baryon--photon ratio $η = n_B/n_γ$ corresponds to more efficient production of deuterium and ultimately to a larger helium $^4\el{He}$ abundance in the present.
Relative element abundances in the present epoch constrain the value of the initial baryon--photon ratio to $η = (6.2 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-10}$ \cite[§\,24.4]{ParticleDataGroup-review-2020}.

\end{figure}


Equipped with a cosmological model of axion interactions, Cadamuro \etal.\ solve the associated Boltzmann equation for the axion abundance $n_a$ over time as a function of mass $m_a$.
At later epochs, the axions eventually decay by $a \to 2γ$, increasing the entropy and abundance of photons in proportion to $n_a$ at late times.
This is measurable as an increase of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), or equivalently, as a decrease in abundance of baryons and neutrinos relative to the CMB.
This can be compared to observation and used to limit the photon excess due to axion decay, in turn limiting $n_a$, which constrains the axion mass $m_a$.
Cadamuro \etal.\ find that the predicted deuterium abundance is reduced two standard deviations below its observed value for axion masses less than $\SI{300}{\kilo\eV}$, thus obtaining the limit
\begin{align}
	m_a \gtrsim \SI{300}{\kilo\eV}
	\label{eqn:cosmo-limit}
\end{align}
at $2σ = \SI{97}{\percent}$ confidence \cite{Cadamuro_2011}.
Axions within this bound decay into photons sufficiently quickly so as not to deviate the outcome of BBN from observation.
Such heavy axions are thermalised at all epochs, even purely hadronic axions which do not undergo Compton scattering (see figure~\ref{fig:axion-freeze-out}).
The limit \eqref{eqn:cosmo-limit} therefore applies to all axion types, and is far more restrictive than laboratory constraints.



\subsection{Constraints from Stellar Evolution}


Galaxies consist of \emph{globular clusters} (GCs), each typically consisting of between $10^5$ and $10^7$ stars.
A typical galaxy like our own hosts hundreds of GCs, each one a gravitationally self-contained island of stars.
The population of a GC can be partitioned into different branches by stage of stellar evolution, as in figure~\ref{fig:globular-cluster}.
Young stars exist in the main sequence and approach the \emph{red giant branch} (RGB) as they burn hydrogen fuel and produce helium.
Red giants approach the helium fusion phase as their cores become \el{He}-dense and \el{H}-depleted.
The ignition of \el{He}-fusion in late-stage red giants causes an immediate rise in temperature and rate of \el{He}-fusion, transitioning the star into a new equilibrium state in the \emph{horizontal branch} (HB) \cite[§\,3.2]{Irastorza_2018}.
The parameter $R \coloneqq N_\text{RGB}/N_\text{HB}$ is defined as the population ratio between the horizontal and red giant branches in a given GC, and is a useful observable for testing models of stellar evolution.

The alleged production of axions in stars has implications for stellar evolution.
Specifically, axion production via the Primakoff process $γ + A \to A + a$ in stellar plasma results in a hotter core temperature and faster burning of helium fuel in red giants.
This affects the relative durations of the RGB and HB stages.
The observed population of stars in each stage of the stellar sequence is statistically proportional to the stage's average lifetime, and thus the observable $R$ parameter measures relative stage lifetimes, $R = N_\text{RGB}/N_\text{HB} = T_\text{RGB}/T_\text{HB}$.
Thus, the axion--photon interaction strength may be constrained by comparing the predicted $R$-parameter to those observed in local GCs.
A recent survey \cite{Stellar-evolution-constraints_2015,Stellar-evolution-constraints_2020} of 39 of GCs reports the constraint $|g_{aγγ}| < \SI{6.5e-11}{\per\giga\eV}$ at \SI{95}{\percent} confidence \cite[§\,3.2]{Irastorza_2018}.
Stronger interacting axions cause horizontal branch stars to burn too quickly, reducing the $R$-parameter below the observed window.

\section{Outlook and Conclusion}

It is only a possibility that axions exist, and if they do, they remain in the ever-shrinking areas of parameter space (a modern exclusion plot shown in figure~\ref{fig:finish-already}).
Despite this, axion phenomenology is earning increasingly more attention.
Many more cosmological tests other than those mentioned in this report exist, and experiments are currently under way to further explore the axion parameter space \cite{Irastorza_2018,landscape_2020,further-lab-experiments_2017}.
Arguably, the reason for its popularity is that the axion conceivably plays a central role in open problems in more than one area of cosmology.


% \subsubsection{A Solution to Dark Matter, Inflation and Baryogenesis?}
\subsubsection{A Solution to Dark Matter, Inflation and Baryogenesis?}

Most notably, the axion exhibits all the necessary features for a cold dark matter candidate.
There are several proposed theoretical frameworks by which the axion comes to contribute (in some cases, totally) to the present dark matter density, estimated to be $ρ_{CDM} \approx \SI{0.45}{\giga\eV\per\cubic\cm}$ \cite[§\,5.3]{landscape_2020}.
One such framework is the \emph{misalignment mechanism}, whereby the present day energy density $ρ_{CDM}$ is stored in the zero modes of the $\bar θ$-vacuum angle as it continues to undergo lightly damped oscillation about the potential minimum at $\bar θ = 0$ after acquiring a large nonzero angle after inflation \cite[§\,5.3]{landscape_2020}.
Assuming axions as solely responsible for dark matter, the axion number density would be
\begin{math}
	n_a \approx \num{4.5e14}\,\qty(\frac{\si{\micro\eV}}{m_a})\,\si{\per\cubic\cm}
.\end{math}
There are numerous active \emph{haloscope experiments} designed to detect ambient axions, making use of coherence effects to overcome their incredibly weak interactions: the \emph{Axion Dark Matter eXperiment} (ADMX) \cite{AMDX-2020} is the longest standing \cite[§\,7]{Irastorza_2018}.

Inflation is the hypothesized period of rapid cosmic expansion in the early universe, invoked to explain certain observed features of the cosmos.
Degrees of freedom known as \emph{inflatons} drive inflation until they reach a potential minimum.
The inflaton potential must be very flat compared to the Hubble scale $c/H$ at the time of inflation.
Axions with a suitable energy scale $f_a$ and mass $m_a$ (incidentally, very different to CDM axions) provide a appropriately flat potential $V(\bar θ)$, making them especially good inflaton candidates \cite[§\,7]{Marsh_2016}.

If that were not enough, the problem of baryogenesis---the evident matter--antimatter asymmetry in the universe---may plausibly be explained by a cosmological evolution of the axion field.
The $\bar θ$-angle must be very small today, as constrained by the neutron electric dipole moment \cite{electric_dipole_neutron_2020}, but it is conceivable that $\bar θ \sim \cal O(1)$ in the very early universe, which may have resulted in preferential generation of matter over antimatter \cite[§\,7.1]{landscape_2020}.

All these features earn the axion a status of special interest in particle physics and cosmology, even with a pessimistic view of its existence.
It has been claimed \cite{Irastorza_2018} that the rapidly improving experimental landscape makes it likely that the axion, if it exists, will be detected in the near future.
In that case, a broad subset of physics would enjoy a revitalising breakthrough, and half a century's worth of theoretical discovery would become tangible progress.
