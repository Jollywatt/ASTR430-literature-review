\begin{abstract}
	The standard model of particle physics suffers from the strong \CP problem---the fine tuning of the QCD $\bar θ$-parameter to the experimental value $|\bar θ| \lesssim \num{1e-10}$.
	This review discusses the theoretical background of QCD and of the strong \CP problem, and describes its most famous resolution: the Peccei--Quinn axion.
	The axion has wide-ranging implications for cosmology and astrophysics, and up-to-date constraints of its properties from various laboratory and cosmological experiments are reviewed.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Jenni Adams for taking me up on what was meant to be a one-semester project, and for letting me wander largely in my own direction and at my own pace.
Thank you for your input and good spirit.
